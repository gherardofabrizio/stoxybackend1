Although Privacy Shield is no longer considered a valid transfer mechanism for the purposes of EU and Swiss data protection law, in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-311/18 and opinion of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland dated 8 September 2020, Stoxy Srl will continue to comply with the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>

        <p>Stoxy Srl adheres to and complies with the Privacy Shield Principles when processing personal information from the EU, UK or Switzerland. If we have received your personal information in the United States and subsequently transfer that information to a third party acting as our agent, and such third party agent processes your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, we will remain liable unless we can prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

        <p>With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Stoxy Srl is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        
        <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
